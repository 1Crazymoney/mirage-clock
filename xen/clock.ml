(* Decomposing a unix time stamp.

   POSIX time counts seconds since the epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
   without counting leap seconds (when a leap second occurs a posix
   second can be two SI seconds or zero SI second). Hence 86_400 posix
   seconds always represent an UTC day and the translation below is
   completly accurate. Note that by definition a unix timestamp cannot
   represent a leap second.

   The algorithm proceeds by dividing the time stamp by 86_400 this
   gives us the number of julian days since the epoch, with that we
   can find the julian day and convert it to a gregorian calendar date
   using [jd_to_greg]. The remainder of initial division is the number
   of remaining number of seconds in that day, it defines the time.

   N.B for negative unix time stamp (stricly speaking undefined on
   gmtime) the proleptic gregorian calendar is used. *)
